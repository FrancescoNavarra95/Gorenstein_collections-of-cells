# Gorenstein Collection of Cells

This repository provides a [Macaulay2](http://www2.macaulay2.com/Macaulay2/) implementation for studying the Gorensteiness of the non-prime binomial ideals associated with collections of cells.  

The project is designed to test the following conjecture:

> **Conjecture.**  
> If $P$ is a domino-stable collection of cells (equivalently, the switching rook polynomial of $P$ is palindromic) and the coordinate ring $K[P]$ is not a domain, then $K[P]$ is Gorenstein.

## Code Structure

The script is divided into two main parts:

1. **Inner 2-minor ideal of a collection of cells**  
   - Construction of the polynomial ring associated to a collection of cells.  
   - Computation of the binomial ideal generated by inner $2$-minors.  

2. **Conjecture test**  
   - A function to check whether a polynomial with non-null coefficients is palindromic.  
   - A routine `TestGor` that verifies the conjecture on a given list of collections of cells.

## Requirements

- [Macaulay2](http://www2.macaulay2.com/Macaulay2/)  
- Packages:  
  - `Binomials`  
  - `TorAlgebra`  

Make sure these packages are loaded in your session before running the main function.  

---

## Usage

loadPackage "Binomials";
loadPackage "TorAlgebra";
load "TestGorenstein.m2";

L = value get("weak_polyplets_n4.txt");
TestGor(L);

The program outputs statistics, writes to a file PalGor_<rank>.txt the collections satisfying the conjecture, and returns counterexamples if any exist.
