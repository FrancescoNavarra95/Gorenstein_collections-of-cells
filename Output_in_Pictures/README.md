## Output in picture format 

This folder contains collections of cells (up to rank 8) and polyominoes (up to rank 11) that are domino-stable, whose coordinate rings are not domains, and are Gorenstein.  

Specifically, you will find:

1. **Python script** – Takes as input a list of collections in `input_collections.txt` and generates a folder containing visualizations of all collections in the list.  

2. **Data folder** – Contains the precomputed collections of cells (up to rank 8) and polyominoes (up to rank 11) that satisfy the above properties, ready for use with analysis or visualization scripts.
